To run the project follow the commands listed below

**Step 1** Fork this Repository


**Step 2** Clone the repository by this command
 ```sh
 git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Multithreads-NITK-HackVerse.git
 ```
 
 ### Prerequisites

**Step 3** Before running the application, install the following requirements-

```sh
Clarifai, Twilio, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, raspberry pi modules
```
 * HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS: 
 ```sh
 raspberrypi 3, bread board, pi cam, IR sensor, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor,buzzer and jumper wires
 ```
 
 **Step 4** Now run the program by this command -
```sh
python3 main.py
```

**Step 5** Now wait for system to get switch on

  * Sytem is ready to work, you can test it by bringing something near the camera e.g, if its any animal picture then it will start the ultrasonic transmittor and buzzer until the animal goes out of the range of Ultrasonic transmitter.
The system will also make an emergency call. 
  * If it is a non-animal picture, the system will do print 'No Animal !!' on the terminal screen and go back to initial state of detecting movement using IR sensor
